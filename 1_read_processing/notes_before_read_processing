A note, porechop requires a specific set up including editing the adapter file in the servers. The adapter that I've made sure it looks for are the following (update this by editing this file: Porechop/build/lib/porechop): 
  Adapter('Rapid',

                    start_sequence=('Rapid_adapter',

                                    'GTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCTTTCGCGTTTTTCGTGCGCCGCTTCA')),

	    

	    Adapter('Rapid Adapter-RA',

                    start_sequence=('Rapid_adapter','TTTTTTTTCCTGTACTTCGTTCAGTTACGTATTGCT')),

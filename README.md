# ONT_data_analysis 
Emily Aguilar-Pine

This repository is largely to help create a baseline for the Baker/De Anda labs to begin processing and analyzing Oxford Nanopore Technologies data from P2 Solo sequencing machines. 

There are 4 main steps for this repository: 

1) Read Processing
2) Assembly
3) Read Mapping to Assemblies
4) Binning

Each of these steps has nuances based on what your project needs are. 
Read Processing here is detailed as a baseline protocol. 
Assembly can change based on if you're coassembling or not. 
Read Mapping to Assemblies can include more or less steps depending on if you do or don't want to bin using differential coverage. 
Binning can include more or less steps depending on if you do or don't want to bin using differential coverage, a coassembly, etc. 

Consider what data you're working with before deciding on a specific workflow. 

If you have specific questions, please raise an issue in the github or email me directly at emily.ap@utexas.edu.
